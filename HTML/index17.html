  <p class="blocktext">This is my first day of my beautiful high school.
     I’m standing on this school field. One guy is asking to every freshman, including me, “Who’s from South Korea?”. I raised my hand.
    <form action="file:///Users/keunyublee/Desktop/index22.html">
    <input type="submit" value="He is coming toward me" />
  </form>.<p>He looked at me and offered me a handshake. He had purple lips. I thought I should not get too close with this guy. He must do some drug. <br><br>*Will Little Kim</p>

    This is my fourth time shooting gun today because I was disqualified to shoot at least 20 targets.
    I don’t understand how I don’t hit the target because
I was aiming perfect. I think it is either my K2, typical Korean rifle, is broken and malfunctioning or
the gun sight is not aligned. It was the most embarrassing experience in my life because there were not
many people who used range four times. Sergeant told me I shot more than 200 rounds.
